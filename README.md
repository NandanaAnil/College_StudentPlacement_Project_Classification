 Student Placement Prediction using Logistic Regression
📌 Project Objective:
This project aims to develop a binary classification model to predict whether a student will be placed or not based on academic, cognitive, and co-curricular attributes. By leveraging historical student data, the model helps educational institutions and students understand key placement factors.

📊 Dataset Overview:
The dataset, college_student_placement_dataset.csv, includes the following key features:

College_ID: Unique identifier for the student's college (later encoded numerically).

IQ: Cognitive score of the student.

Prev_Sem_Result: Previous semester's GPA/marks.

CGPA: Cumulative GPA.

Academic_Performance: Subjective rating (e.g., out of 10).

Internship_Experience: Binary (Yes/No), later mapped to 1/0.

Extra_Curricular_Score: Score reflecting extracurricular involvement.

Communication_Skills: Communication skill rating.

Projects_Completed: Number of academic or personal projects.

Placement: Target variable indicating placement status.

🔧 Data Preprocessing:
Checked for and handled missing/null values.

Encoded categorical variables like College_ID and Internship_Experience into numerical formats.

Used value_counts() to analyze frequency distribution across various fields like colleges and internship experience.

📈 Model Development:
Split the dataset using train_test_split() from Scikit-learn.

Implemented Logistic Regression, a widely used linear model for binary classification.

Trained the model on the training set.

📉 Model Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy Score: Measures the overall correctness of the model.

Confusion Matrix: Gives insight into true positives, false positives, etc.

Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes (Placed / Not Placed).

📌 Technologies Used:
Languages & Libraries: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Machine Learning Algorithm: Logistic Regression

✅ Conclusion:
This model serves as a predictive tool to estimate the placement probability of a student, helping stakeholders identify key success factors like internships, communication, and academic performance. The project showcases end-to-end data science skills — from data wrangling to model deployment.
